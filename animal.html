        <p class='p-text'>Pit Bulls are the number one dog to get miss treated and abandoned.
        They are used many times in illegal dog fighting and there is about 5,435 pit bulls up for adoption.
        Each year ther is 1.2 million dogs euthanized and 40% of them are pit bulls, so half a million are being killed annually.
        This could be the result of them being the most feared breed.
        Many times Pit Bulls are abused causing them to be violent and lash out.
        In 2000 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined the data from media reports and the Humane Society,
        they found that pit bulls were in approximately one-third of dog bit related fatalities in the US between 1981 and 1992.
        However in 2014 the American Veterinary Medical Association did a controlled study stating they have not identified pit bulls as disproportionately dangerous.
        The AVMA came to the conclusion that this may relate to the popularity of the breed.</p>

          <p class='p-text'> German Shepherds are fourth on the list. They are a working dog breed, who originated from Germany in 1899.
            They were meant for herding sheep, but their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience caused them to become a preferred breed.
            They are now used for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.
            The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club.</p>
